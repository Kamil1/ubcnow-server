# API v1 Draft

This is a draft specification for version 1 of the ubcnow-server REST API.

Many things are likely to change before finalization.

## Using the API

### Encoding

All body requests and responses are encoded in JSON. The fields in the
specification for each model object directly correspond to its JSON
fields in requests and responses, unless otherwise indicated.

### Versioning

All API calls must be preceded by a version identifier:

    http://host:port/api/v1/

Alternatively, you may also request the latest API:

    http://host:port/api/latest/

All endpoints documented are expressed relative to the above URL.

### Parameters

URL parameters are expressed with :this notation.

Optional parameters are in parentheses.

## Authentication

TBD

#### Example Data

TODO

## Users

TODO: (probably best to wait on auth for this one)

## Groups

A 'group' is a classification composed of users who wish to receive a certain
type of notification.

TODO: groups admin API

### Specification

| Field      | Type            | Description                                            | Required |

#### Example Data

### Examples

A concrete group would be the UBC math club.

An abstract group would be a "bus notifications" group.

## Interest

An interest is a classification indicated by individual users. Interests are paired with 
groups to identify potential Blips of interest.

### Specification

| Field      | Type          | Description                                             | Required |

# Blip Stream

ubcnow-server can communicate real-time events to clients connected using unidirectional WebSockets.

JSON blobs representing 'updates' are sent over the WebSocket stream.

## Update Specification

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| type  | enum { add, update, delete }| Denotes the type of update. |
| id | Long | The blip being added, updated, or deleted.
